function presleep_EEG_mat = extract_pre_sleep_EEG(sbj2)
% Extract the pre-sleep-onset EEG signal from the Patient class, and output
% it as a matrix (num_chs x num_samps), where num_chs -> number of EEG
% channels, num_samps -> number of datapoints in EEG period
% (period_duration_in_minutes x 60 seconds x sampling rate).
